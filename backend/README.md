# Restaurant Review Serverside

**In this project I built a server side through mongoAtlas that allows users to search for restaurant's name, zipcode, cuisine. Users can also create, update, delete reviews on restaurants.**

#### Routes
`/api/restaurants`: (additional params: zipcode, name, cuisine
  - GET /api/restaurants/id/:id
  - GET /api/restaurants/cuisines
  
`/api/restaurants/review`: POST, PUT, DELETE reviews

_This project was built from freecodecamp.org's course._
